The Coin Guessing Game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The player guesses the outcome of two hidden coins (Heads or Tails). It tracks attempts, displays feedback, and allows restarting.

HTML:

Displays game results, attempts count, and hidden coin values.

CSS:
The body has centered content with a light background.
The game container is styled with a white background, rounded corners, and a shadow.
Coins are displayed in circular bowls, with thumbs-up or smiley emojis indicating success or failure.
Input fields and buttons are styled for usability.

JavaScript:
Randomly selects two coin values (Heads or Tails).
Validates player guesses and tracks attempts.
Displays success or failure messages and shows/hides elements like the restart button.
Resets the game when restarted, randomizing coin values again.
